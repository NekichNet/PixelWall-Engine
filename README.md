# PixelWall-Engine

A game engine includes isometric graphic by glfw library, level-by-level gameplay, simple physics for rect-shaped objects and point-and-click characters' manipulations.

I prefer GLFW as graphic library and [FMOD-Audio-Engine](https://github.com/rosshoyt/FMOD-Audio-Engine) because of simple implementation and due to the amount of reference material.

You can track this with [Kanban board](https://evstropov.kaiten.ru/space/538381/boards).
